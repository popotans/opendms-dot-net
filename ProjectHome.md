# What is OpenDMS.NET #

First, OpenDMS.NET aims to be a document management system.

# Why another DMS? #

Well, this DMS will eventually aim to meet the demands of a few hundred users.  Additionally, it will support multiple client implementations.  Many of the free and open source DMS systems currently available are all web-based.  While in many situations this is viable, sometimes a software based solution just works better.  Well OpenDMS.NET will utilize standardized open specifications to allow a multitude of client options.

# What is the state of the project? #

OpenDMS.NET is currently in development and has no release ready for testing.

# How does OpenDMS.NET work? #

OpenDMS.NET is a HttpModule.  Thus, it can be “plugged” into any ASP.NET website and once both OpenDMS.NET and the website server are properly configured, it will provide a DMS server on that system.

# Why is OpenDMS.NET useful? #

OpenDMS.NET will offer a DMS server capable of both access and version control.  Access controls allow system administrators to setup permissions on resources per user and/or group.  Version control will prevent simultaneous changes by multiple users while tracking changes to each resource allowing reverting to older versions.

# How can I help? #

I thought you would never ask!  I would greatly appreciate any assistance, from design to documentation and development.
